## 🌍 Mission
Our goal is to revolutionize disaster response by leveraging drones to reach inaccessible areas in disaster situations, create faster response times to emergencies, and alleviate pressues on government, NGO's with regards to aid distribution.

## 📖 About
Sentinel-AId is a AI driven disaster management system. It has 3 main features:        
1) **S.O.S. Request**: Allows citizens to summon a drone in hard to reach regions to collect footage on emergency situation. 
2) **Footage Analysis System**: Processes drone footage by breaking it down into various frames with information such as Damage severity, Critical response level, Infrastructure affected, Health Hazards, etc. 
3) **Aid Exchange**: A community driven resource aid exchange where victims can input locations and request aid. And others can summon drones to pickup supplies and deliver them to those in need.
